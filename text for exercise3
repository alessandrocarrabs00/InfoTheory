Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and key figure in the scientific revolution. Born in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, Newton is best known for formulating the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which laid the foundation for classical mechanics. His book *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (1687), often referred to as the *Principia*, is considered one of the most important works in the history of science. Newton also made significant contributions to mathematics, including the development of calculus (independently of Leibniz), and optics, where he studied the nature of light and color. He served as the president of the Royal Society and held a position as Master of the Royal Mint. Newton’s work transformed the understanding of the physical world and deeply influenced later scientific inquiry.
